# Color-Detection-with-OpenCV
# Real-Time Color Detection with OpenCV

Welcome to my **Real-Time Color Detection** project! This project demonstrates how to detect a specific color (yellow) in a live video stream using Python and OpenCV. It highlights the detected color with a bounding box.

### üì∑ Demo

This project uses a webcam feed to detect the color yellow in real-time. When the color is detected, the system draws a green bounding box around the yellow object.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

### üîç Features
- Real-time color detection using webcam feed.
- Detection of a specific color (yellow in this case).
- Bounding box drawn around detected color.
- Easy to modify to detect other colors.
